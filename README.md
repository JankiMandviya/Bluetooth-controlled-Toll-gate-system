# Bluetooth-controlled-Toll-gate-system

This project is created using Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor and servo motor. The ultra sonic sensor detects the presence of any vehicle. This sensor is connected to Arduino UNO development board. As the sensor detects any vehicle , the output of the sensor is given to Arduino and the servo motor closes the path. To open this path a single command "$" is given in mobile application which is connected to Arduino board through bluetooth module (HC-05).
